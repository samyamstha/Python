The program either creates a new index file (if in case it is not present) and adds the links of the socialite profiles to it, or else it updates the index file(if it is already present) by appending the new socialite profile link(s) to the list of older socialite profiles, everytime a new socialite profile is created. Thus retaining the old socialite profiles, instead of creating a new index file in every run.
